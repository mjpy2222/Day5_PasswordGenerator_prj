Password Generator from Day 5 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp
This Python code generates a password based on how many characters, symbols, and numbers a user inputs. 
It then shuffles the list to produce a randomized password with the generated characters, symbols, and numbers. 

includes list comprehension code from Day 29; (I did not upload original Day 5 previously to Github)
*List comprehension makes this code more efficient from that of Day 5.
